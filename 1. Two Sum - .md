## 思路:

* This question is an easy question

* All we need is a HashMap to store all appeared num

* if HashMap contains target - current it means we get the answer

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hash_map = {}
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            sub = target - nums[i]
            if (sub in hash_map):
                return [i, hash_map[sub]]
            hash_map[nums[i]] = i
