## 思路:

1. The determination of create extra room is depend on the samllest ending time
2. This is an interval question.
3. For most of any interval questions, sort first.
4. Sort by starting time(ascending).
5. Then create a PriorityQueue and sort by ending time(ascending).
6. Since the PQ will always return us the smallest ending time.
7. So we only need to check if the current starting time is > or < than the smallest ending time.
8. If the current starting time is > than the smallest ending time, then those two intervals are not overlap, (no additional room required)
9. If the current starting time is < than the smallest ending time, then those two intervals overlap, (need additional room.)
10. Sort by staring time, we want to make sure all small starting time meeting get pushed into the queue ealy.
11. Queue sort by ending time, We know the shorest endting time, or in another word, the easliest room we can use.

    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        if not intervals:
            return 0
        
        intervals.sort(key= lambda x: x[0])
    
        heap = []
        
        for i in range(0, len(intervals)):
            current_start, current_end = intervals[i]
            heappush(heap, current_end)
            previous_end = heap[0]

            if previous_end <= current_start:
                heappop(heap)
            
        return len(heap)
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int minMeetingRooms(int[][] intervals) {
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (i1, i2) -> i1[0] - i2[0]);    
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>((i1, i2) -> i1[1] - i2[1]);
        for (int[] meeting: intervals) {
            heap.offer(meeting);
            if (heap.peek()[1] <= meeting[0]) { heap.poll(); }    
        }
        return heap.size();
    }
