## 思路:

* The determination to create extra room depends on the smallest ending time
* This is an interval question.
* For most of any interval questions, sort first.
* Sort by starting time(ascending).
* Then create a `PriorityQueue` and sort by ending time(ascending).
* Since the `PQ` will always return us with the smallest ending time.
* So we only need to check if the current starting time is > or < than the smallest ending time.
* If the current starting time is > than the smallest ending time, then those two intervals are not overlapping, (no additional room required)
* If the current starting time is < than the smallest ending time, then those two intervals overlap, (need additional room.)
* Sort by starting time, we want to make sure all small starting time meetings get pushed into the queue early.
* Queue sort by ending time, We know the shortest ending time, or in another word, the earliest room we can use.
